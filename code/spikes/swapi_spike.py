# TODO: If we're hosting this as a website, we need to work around this:
# Options: 
# - Caching the data, only request every X hours
# - Since it's limited by IP Address, we can request directly to the SWAPI from the browser in Javascript

# Search API Feature
# TODO: Extra Feature: Search functionality? For the user.

# Can request the schema of any resource, TODO: what are our resources?

# Extra Feature: Wookie Mode? Make all requests with `?format=wookiee`
